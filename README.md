# Olympic-Medal-Prediction-Model
This project focuses on building a model to predict Olympic medals based on historical data of athletes and their participation in the Summer Olympics. The data is processed to generate team summaries, including past performance metrics, which serve as features for predicting future medal counts.

The cleaned and processed dataset is saved as olympics.csv, containing team statistics and previous performance metrics, which can be used for further analysis or machine learning models for predicting future medals.

The dataset used is athlete_events.csv From kaggle, containing historical Olympic data, including athletes, events, and medals won.
